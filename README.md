# Google Forms Using OOP (C++)

This repository contains an implementation of a **Google Forms-style application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**. The project models core functionalities of a form system using classes, encapsulation, and other OOP principles to simulate form creation, question handling, and response collection.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how object-oriented design can be used to build an interactive form system similar in concept to Google Forms. The application allows users to define forms, add questions, collect responses, and organize stored data. It focuses on design principles like abstraction, modularity, and reusability using C++.

The codebase highlights practical usage of OOP concepts through real-world simulation of a form system, emphasizing class hierarchy, data structures, and interaction logic.

---

## 🎯 Features

This project includes functionalities such as:

- Creation of multiple forms
- Adding various types of questions (e.g., text, multiple-choice)
- Collecting and storing responses
- Displaying form summaries
- Modularity through OOP design

## 🧪 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irfafarooq-ee/Google-Forms-using-OOP
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Copy code
```bash
cd Google-Forms-using-OOP
```

### 3. Compile and Run
Compile the example programs using a C++ compiler such as g++, gcc, etc.:

# 🔧 Working
The example programs in this repository illustrate how to:

-Define a new form

-Add questions dynamically

-Accept responses from users

-Display stored form data

You can expand on this structure to add more interactive features, persistence, or graphical UI layers.

# 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
This project highlights:

-Classes and Objects

-Inheritance and Polymorphism

-Encapsulation and Interfaces

-Composition of Objects

-Dynamic memory and data structures

By organizing functionality into well-defined classes, the program remains scalable and easy to extend.
